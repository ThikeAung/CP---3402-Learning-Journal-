# Practical 5
# Week - 05

# Learning Activities & Resources

This week, I focused on creating a child theme for my LeafyLift WordPress site. I followed WordPress developer documentation to set up a child theme directory, create a style.css file that references the parent theme, and build a functions.php file to enqueue the child theme styles properly.

For customizations, I implemented at least six visible changes:
1. Changed the primary color scheme to better reflect the LeafyLift brand
2. Customized the header layout for a cleaner, modern look
3. Adjusted typography for better readability and consistency
4. Styled buttons to have rounded corners and a hover effect
5. Modified the footer section to include additional contact info and social media links
6. Added custom CSS for a more visually appealing product grid layout

# Content Insights

Building a child theme taught me the importance of maintaining theme updates without losing customizations. I learned how to properly inherit styles from a parent theme and override specific elements with my own CSS. Through the functions.php file, I also understood how WordPress enqueues styles and scripts, which is vital for performance and modular design.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
