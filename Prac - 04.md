# Practical 4
# Week - 04

- Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I focused on setting up a local development environment for my LeafyLift CMS website. I installed XAMPP to create a localhost server and successfully moved my WordPress site from CloudAccess.net to my local machine. I used the All-in-One WP Migration plugin to export my website and import it into my local WordPress environment.

Helpful resources I used:

Setting up the local environment helped me understand the importance of working locally for development and testing before pushing changes to the live server. I learned how XAMPP provides an Apache server and MySQL database that work just like a production server. I also got more familiar with WordPress database connections and how site URLs need to be adjusted when moving between environments.

- Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Learning to deploy and manage a local development environment is a crucial skill for a cloud engineer. It not only improves the development workflow but also minimizes risks when making changes to a live website. Moving my LeafyLift site to localhost taught me practical skills around database management, WordPress migration, and local development environments â€” all of which are highly relevant for my future in cloud-native technologies.
