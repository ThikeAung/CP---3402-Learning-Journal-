**Practical Number & Week:**  
# Prac 7 - PHP (Week X)

**Learning Activities & Resources:**  
In this practical, I developed a basic PHP website to demonstrate key programming concepts. The site included multiple PHP files and implemented functionalities such as echoing HTML content, using decision-making statements, loops, functions, and including reusable files. The main features developed were:
- **index.php**: Displays a welcome message, loops through an array, and shows dynamic content based on time.
- **login.php**: Implements a simple login form and authentication function.
- **header.php & footer.php**: Common header and footer elements included in multiple pages using `include`.

To test the project, I ran it on a local server using XAMPP. I uploaded the PHP files to the `htdocs` directory, started Apache, and accessed the project via `http://localhost/php-demo/`.

# Helpful Resources: 
- [PHP Official Documentation](https://www.php.net/docs.php)  
- XAMPP setup guide from Apache Friends  
- W3Schools PHP tutorials for loops and functions  
- Online PHP Sandbox for quick testing  

**Estimated Hours:**  
- Setting up and coding: 3 hours  
- Debugging and testing: 1.5 hours  
- Writing journal and submission: 1 hour  
Total: **5.5 hours**

**Content Insights:**  
- Learned how to use `echo` for dynamically generating HTML content.
- Implemented `if/else` statements for decision-making.
- Used loops (`foreach`, `for`, and `while`) to iterate through arrays and display data.
- Created and used functions with parameters for reusable logic.
- Applied `include` statements to manage common site elements efficiently.
- Understood how form handling works with the `$_POST` method for user authentication.

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights:**  
This practical improved my understanding of PHP fundamentals, which are crucial for backend web development. Implementing a basic login system gave me insights into authentication processes, an essential skill in web security. Using `include` for common files demonstrated the importance of modular programming, which enhances code maintainability. These concepts will be useful when working with PHP-based CMS platforms like WordPress or developing custom backend solutions for web applications.

Overall, this exercise strengthened my PHP skills and prepared me for more advanced topics like database integration and session management in future projects.
