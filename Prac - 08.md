**Practical 8 - Learning Experiments**

---

### **Learning Activities & Experiment**

#### **Background & Rationale**  
Over the past weeks, I have been learning CMS concepts using various study techniques. However, I noticed that I sometimes struggle to recall details when applying them in practical tasks. This made me question whether my current study methods were truly effective for long-term retention. 

To improve my learning efficiency, I decided to conduct a structured experiment comparing **active recall** with **passive review** to determine which method enhances my understanding and retention of CMS concepts more effectively.

#### **Hypothesis**  
Using active recall techniques (such as self-quizzing and spaced repetition) while learning CMS concepts will lead to better retention and understanding compared to passive review methods (such as rereading notes and highlighting key points). 

Active recall forces the brain to retrieve information, strengthening memory associations, whereas passive review creates familiarity but may not reinforce long-term retention. 

#### **Test Methodology**  
To test this hypothesis, I structured my study sessions over three days. I selected **two equal sets of CMS topics**, ensuring they were of similar difficulty. One set was studied using active recall, while the other was reviewed passively. The topics covered included CMS themes, plugins, security measures, and performance optimization.

##### **Study Groups**  
1. **Active Recall Group**  
   - Created flashcards (using Anki) with key CMS concepts and questions.  
   - Attempted to recall answers before checking notes.  
   - Repeated flashcards at increasing intervals using spaced repetition.  
   - Summarized topics in my own words instead of copying from notes.  

2. **Passive Review Group**  
   - Read through my notes multiple times.  
   - Highlighted important sections.  
   - Wrote summaries by copying from notes without testing recall.  
   - Did not engage in self-quizzing or retrieval practice.  

##### **Testing & Evaluation**  
On the fourth day, I designed a **10-question test** covering both sets of topics. The test included:  
- **5 factual recall questions** (e.g., “What is the purpose of a child theme in WordPress?”)  
- **3 conceptual questions** requiring explanations (e.g., “Why is caching important for CMS performance?”)  
- **2 application-based questions** (e.g., “How would you improve CMS security on a live website?”)  

After completing the test, I evaluated my accuracy, confidence, and ease of answering the questions.

#### **Results & Observations**  
| Study Method | Test Score (Out of 10) | Confidence Level | Ease of Recall |
|-------------|--------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Active Recall | **9/10** | High | Easy |
| Passive Review | **6/10** | Moderate | Difficult |

Key Observations:  
- **Higher retention**: I recalled more details in the active recall group and answered with greater confidence.  
- **Stronger conceptual understanding**: The active recall method made it easier to explain and apply concepts, while passive review led to more surface-level understanding.  
- **Greater long-term retention**: Even a day after the test, I could still recall most details from the active recall group but struggled with the passive review topics.  
- **Perceived difficulty**: Active recall felt harder initially but proved to be more effective in the long run.

### **Estimated Hours Spent**  
- Experiment Setup: **1 hour**  
- Study Sessions: **3 hours** (1.5 hours per method)  
- Test & Analysis: **1 hour**  
- Reflection & Insights: **1 hour**  
- **Total: 6 hours**

### **Content Insights**  
- **Active recall significantly improves memory retention** compared to passive review.  
- **Spaced repetition enhances learning efficiency** and reduces forgetting over time.  
- **Summarizing in my own words** was more beneficial than copying notes.  
- **Self-testing is a powerful learning tool** that I should integrate into all technical subjects.

### **Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
- This experiment confirmed that **active recall is essential for mastering technical concepts**, which will help in my future CMS projects.  
- **Spaced repetition and self-quizzing** could be useful for **certification exams** in cloud computing, data science, and other fields.  
- I plan to **replace passive review with structured recall techniques** in my learning strategy.  
- These insights could improve my ability to **retain and apply knowledge in professional settings**.

### **Conclusion**  
This experiment validated that **active recall is significantly more effective** than passive review for learning CMS concepts. Moving forward, I will incorporate **flashcards, spaced repetition, and self-quizzing** into my study routine. By doing so, I can **enhance my long-term retention and practical understanding**, which is essential for both academic success and career growth.
