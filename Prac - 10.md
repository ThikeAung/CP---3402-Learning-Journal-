# Prac 10 – Presentation Rehearsals

## Learning Activities & Resources:

This week focused on preparing for our group presentation through a series of rehearsals and a technical setup check. Key activities included:

- Conducting a stand-up meeting to share individual updates, align on responsibilities, and identify any gaps.  
- Performing a full **tech check** in the presentation room – testing laptop compatibility with the projector, adjusting camera angles, and verifying microphone and audio clarity.  
- Rehearsing the group presentation **three times**, identifying areas of improvement after each round.  
- Making changes to our slide deck, refining script transitions between speakers, and simplifying technical content for better audience engagement.  
- Practising a **live demo** to simulate the actual presentation environment and ensure smooth interactions.  
- Recording the final rehearsal and uploading it as an **unlisted YouTube video** for submission and self-review.  
- Timing the full presentation to ensure it stayed within the required 10-minute limit.  

To complete these tasks, I referred to:

- The **presentation assignment document** and **marking rubric** to guide rehearsal improvements.  
- Online tutorials for adjusting lighting and sound for video recording.  
- YouTube upload settings to manage video privacy and sharing.

## Estimated Hours:

- **Total time spent**: ~6.5 hours  
  - Stand-up meeting and planning – 0.5 hour  
  - Technical setup and testing – 1 hour  
  - Rehearsals and team feedback – 3 hours  
  - Video recording and upload – 1 hour  
  - Journal writing and reflection – 1 hour  

## Content Insights:

- Rehearsals are essential to identifying presentation flow issues, slide inconsistencies, and unclear messaging.  
- Practising with real equipment (e.g., projector, microphones) prevents last-minute tech surprises.  
- Timing each run helped us manage pacing and allowed smoother transitions between speakers.  
- Re-watching the video revealed improvement areas in delivery such as tone, speed, and body language.  
- Running a realistic demo gave us confidence in handling the live product walkthrough during the actual presentation.  

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

- Presentation skills are essential in both academic and professional settings, especially for client-facing roles.  
- This exercise helped me build confidence in public speaking and working effectively in a team under pressure.  
- Practising live demos reflected real-world scenarios where developers and project teams pitch ideas or software to stakeholders.  
- Learning how to troubleshoot audio/video issues and maintain engagement during a presentation are valuable transferable skills.  
- Effective collaboration, feedback processing, and rapid iteration are highly relevant in agile environments.
