# Content Insights 
- WordPress has a more user-friendly interface compared to Joomla, making content management easier.
- The block editor (Gutenberg) simplifies content structuring, unlike Joomla’s more rigid module-based approach.
- Uploading content and configuring themes was straightforward, though I couldn’t explore advanced customizations due to time constraints.
- Hosting on CloudAccess.net provided a seamless way to manage WordPress without manual installation, similar to Joomla.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights 
- Though I couldn’t spend as much time as planned, I got hands-on experience with WordPress hosting and deployment, which is valuable for CMS-related roles.
- The transition from Joomla to WordPress reinforced the importance of choosing the right CMS based on project needs and ease of use.
- Since I missed the group formation exercise due to medical leave, I will need to coordinate later to find a team, highlighting the importance of communication and adaptability in professional settings.
This week reminded me that balancing health and work is crucial—sometimes, prioritizing recovery is necessary for long-term productivity.
